All the *main.py files in the folder were used in order to train different neural networks with difference number of layers
The data used to train the neural networks can be found in the gameData folder
The data used to train the value network can be found in the valueData folder
For the submission, most of the data was removed as the files were quite large and only significant examples were left
The learn class was used to try to use the reinforce algorithm to teach a neural network how to better play hus by playing against itself.
The model folder was used to store different version of the neural network as the learning occured as well as the value network.
Many models were also removed in order to reduce the size of the submission
